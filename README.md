# StuntCopter

This is a reimplementation of [StuntCopter by Duane Blehm](https://archive.org/details/TheDuaneBlehmCollection) for the [Playdate](https://play.date). It has a few notable distinctions from the original: the playfield is smaller due to the size of the Playdate's screen versus the original Macintosh display, using the d-pad instead of a mouse makes the game a bit more difficult to control (in my opinion), and the game automatically ends after level 5.

The sounds were recorded through StuntCopter 1.0 running in Mini vMac. The graphics were extracted from the original program using ResEdit.

There are probably a lot of bugs! If you find any, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. 

## The Game

The objective of the game is to drop the jumper into the hay on the wagon. Score is awarded based on the height of the jump and the current level. After 5 successful landings, the level (and difficulty) increases. Hitting the horse or the driver ends the game immediately. Hitting the ground will allow play to continue, but the game will end at the end of the level.

Press B to start the game, and A to jump. The d-pad adjusts the yoke, which controls the velocity of the copter.
